Lab 19

This app allows you to create simple text posts that you can also edit and save! It You can give it a Title and the date is automatically given to the post. This was set up with django. I went in a virtual python environment and then started a project called blogproject. I additionally created an app called blog. Blog had files where I could set up urls, my models, and my views, as well as my static css file and my html. To run it, just do python manage.py runserver and it should run locally.
